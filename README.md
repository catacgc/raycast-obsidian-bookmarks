# Obsidian Bookmarks

- Install the [Obsidan Local Rest API Plugin](https://github.com/coddingtonbear/obsidian-local-rest-api)
    - go to settings, copy the local token
- Add the extension to Raycast, configure the fully qualified vault path when prompted `/Users/user/Documents/Vault Path`

- Optional: install the Advanced URI plugin if you want to directly open notes containing bookmarks directly from Raycast

## Usage

Simply add tags in obsidian to URLs that you want to then show in your bookmark search in a note. Ex: `#res/dashboard` or `#res`. All `#res` bookmarks are going to be fetched 

Example Obisidian Note:

```

## Resources

- A good resource to read later [here](a-link) #res/read-later
- [My dashboard to see the data](another-link) #res/dashboard
```
